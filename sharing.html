        <h3>Find out more about this topic</h3>
        <p>
          The big advantage of apps is they're simple to use—even for
          technophobes—and they let you grant access to family and friends. Many
          are free or charge a minimal fee. On the downside, technical support
          can be hard to come by and users run the risk of glitches or even
          shutdowns. For that reason, it's always a good idea to back up your
          photos in other secure places.
        </p>
        <h3>Apps that really offer privacy</h3>
        <p>
          There are dozens of photo-sharing apps out there, but not all
          thoroughly address privacy concerns. The picks below are both easy to
          use and truly off limits to others.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.23snaps.com/">23 Snaps</a> (Free): Founded when
            a father-in-waiting wanted a secure way to document and privately
            share the early moments of his young family, 23Snaps says its
            mission is to "create truly secure and private ways to share photos
            and videos with the people you love." The app, which you can access
            via phone, tablet, or Web browser, lets you organize your photos
            into collections or view them in a timeline, gallery or calendar
            view.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://cluster.co/">Cluster</a> (Free) First launched in
            2013 and updated in 2015, the app is designed specifically for
            private group sharing—it doesn't even offer a public access option.
            It also has many of the same features as Facebook or Instagram,
            including likes and alerts. Better yet, you can create specific
            groups for photo sharing, whether it's one side of the family, a
            specific group of friends, or around a trip or an event.
