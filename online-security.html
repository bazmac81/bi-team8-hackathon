      <!-- list of steps -->
      <ol>
        <li>
          Password Strength: The easiest way to keep an account secure is a
          strong password. This means at least 10 characters long, using letters
          and numbers. Also try to avoid using birthdays, initials etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not re-use passwords: Each account should have its own unique
          password. Using the same password multiple times can lead to you
          losing access to everything if your password is stolen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a password manager: A password manager is an app that you can use
          to generate, and store your passwords for all of your accounts. By
          using a password manager you only need to know one password, and this
          means you can make it as complicated and strong as possible. Below you
          will find links to a number of popular options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use two-factor Authentication: Two-factor Authentication is a feature
          that can be enabled on many services. This feature will use your phone
          number, or email address to send you a code each time you log on from
          a new location or device. You would then need to enter this code to
          complete your login.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dont open strange links: Always be wary of opening links in emails, or
          messages, when you are not completely sure what it is for. If you have
          any doubts, check with whoever sent it to you.
        </li>
