    <h1>Online Security</h1>
    <p>
      One of the most important things to remember when using the Internet, is
      Security. This means the security of your email account, your Social Media
      account, Online Banking account etc
    </p>
    <p>This article contains a number of steps you can take to ensure that your accounts stay secure, and to protect you from security breach's</p>

        <li>
            <h2>Strong Passwords</h2>
            <p>One of the easiest ways to keep your online accounts secure is to use a strong password. The password should be at least 10 characters long, and use a mix of letters, both upper and lower case, and numbers.</p>
            <p>It is also important not to use the same password for multiple accounts. This ensures that even if one account is compromised, the others will still be secure</p>
            <p>One problem with strong passwords, is that you will have to remember all of them! Not an easy task if you have a lot! This leads on to step 2 below.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Use a password manager</h2>
            <p>You can also use an automated password manager, which generates baffling strings of characters, all controlled by one strong password that you create. Because you will need to remember this password — as well any other complicated passwords, you should devise a system that’s intuitive for you (but not obvious).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Use multi-factor authentication</h2>
            <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts. Once you enter your password, you'll get a code sent to your phone to make sure it's you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Don't open links you don't know</h2>
            <p></p>
